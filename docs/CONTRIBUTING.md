## Code of Conduct

All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- Attach relevant logs or screenshots, if applicable.

### Feature Requests

- Explain why the feature is needed and how it benefits users.
- Provide potential use cases.
- Suggest implementation ideas, if possible.

### Code Contributions

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` to get started.
- Discuss your approach before starting a major change.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow GitHub Flow:

- `main` branch is the stable, production-ready code.
- Feature branches (`feature/branch-name`) are created from `main`.
- Bug fix branches (`fix/branch-name`) are created from `main`.
- Hotfixes (`hotfix/branch-name`) are directly merged into `main` with a patch release.

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

- `feat: Add new user authentication method`
- `fix: Resolve issue with login timeout`
- `docs: Update README with setup instructions`
- `test: Add unit tests for login functionality`

### Pull Request Process

- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
- Run tests before submitting.
- Provide a clear description of your changes.
- Reference related issues in the description.
- Request reviews from relevant team members.
- Address feedback promptly.

## Coding Standards

- Follow language-specific best practices (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript).
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
- Follow the project's testing framework (e.g., Jest, PyTest, JUnit).

## Documentation

- Update the README for any changes that impact usage.
- Document API endpoints, parameters, and expected responses.
- Maintain inline comments for complex logic.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality and well-structured codebase. Happy coding!
